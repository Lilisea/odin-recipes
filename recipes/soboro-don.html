        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe was inspired by <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/tori-soboro-donburi/">Just One Cookbook's Soboro Don Recipe</a>.</p>
        <p>My version uses beef mince instead of chicken mince and substitutes Sake for Chinese Rice Wine (though use Sake if you have it, I am sure that makes it even nicer!)</br>
            I love this recipe as it is quick and simple to cook, is packed with protein while also being very tasty and comforting.<br>
            I tend to use 500g of beef mince for this, which makes <strong>approx 4 portions</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the Soboro Beef</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Beef mince</li>
            <li>2 inch knob of ginger</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Chinese Rice Wine (or Sake if you have it)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Mirin</li>
            <li>1.5 Tbsp sugar (or more if you prefer a sweeter taste)</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For the Scrambled Eggs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6-8 large eggs </li>
            <li>1-2 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>Generous sprinkle of salt</li>
            <li>Generous sprinkle of pepper</li>
            <li>1.5 Tbsp sugar (or more if you prefer a sweeter taste)</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        </ul>

         <h4>For Serving</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Jasmine rice (or use Japanese short grain if you have it)</li>
            <li>1-2 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>Handful of green peas or beans</li>
            <li>Pickled ginger (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook rice in your preferred way (for me it is a rice cooker!) I tend to start the rice at the beginning so it is just ready when I finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Mince or grate the ginger.</li>
            <li>Combine the mince, rice wine, sugar, soy sauce and ginger, break the mince into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Add ingredients to a pot and set to medium heat, cook until browned.</li>
            <li>At this point you can either add the peas/beans to the meat or steam them separately.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook until the meat has released its juices and most of the liquid has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Set aside and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Mix the eggs, sugar, salt and pepper in a jug until fully combined</li>
            <li>Cook the eggs in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat with a small amount of olive oil or butter.</li>
            <li>Stir often, removing the egg from the bottom and edges.</li>
            <li>Cook the eggs until they are soft and fluffy to your preferred consistency.</li>
            <li>Assemble the bowl with a serving of rice at the bottom then half and half eggs and meat on the top. If the peas/beans were cooked separately they can go in the middle.</li>
        </ol>
