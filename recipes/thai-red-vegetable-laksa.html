        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe was inspired by <a href="https://www.hellofresh.co.uk/recipes/fragrant-chicken-laksa-wk44-59b01c7830a03b7fb7310a82">Hello Fresh's Fragrant Chicken Laksa recipe</a>.</p>
        <p>The chicken version is lovely, but since I didn't have chicken in the fridge at the time, I made a vegetable version with all the vegetables I had in the fridge. It was a huge success!</br>
            Feel free to substitute with chicken, or your preferred alternative vegetables or meat.</p>
        <p>This recipe is not fully vegetarian as it contains chicken stock and fish sauce in the curry paste, but this can be substituted with vegetable stock and a vegetarian curry paste if required.</br>
            It should serve roughly 2 people.</p>
