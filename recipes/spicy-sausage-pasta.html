        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe was inspired by <a href="https://kitchenswagger.com/sausage-stuffed-shells-recipe">Kitchenswagger's Sausage Stuffed Shells Recipe</a>.</p>
        <p>My version uses any regular spicy sausage and whatever pasta shape you have in your kitchen (personally shells or rigatoni are a favourite!).</br>
            This is a go to easy meal for me, and I find it a nice alternative sometimes to a spag bol. I hope you like it as much as I do! <br>
            I tend to use a 500g pack of pasta for this. For us it makes <strong>approx 5 portions</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
